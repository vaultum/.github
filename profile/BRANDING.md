# Vaultum Brand Guidelines

## Official Logo: Hexagonal Modular V

As of September 2025, Vaultum has adopted a new visual identity featuring the **Hexagonal Modular V** logo.

### Design Principles

The new logo embodies our core values:

- **üî∑ Modularity**: Hexagonal segments represent building blocks that connect
- **üõ°Ô∏è Security**: Strong geometric structure symbolizes protection
- **‚ö° Innovation**: Modern gradient and technical aesthetic
- **üîÑ Flexibility**: The "V" flows through modular components

### Visual Elements

- **Shape**: Hexagonal frame with modular V centerpiece
- **Colors**: Gradient from `#00D4FF` (cyan) to `#0066FF` (blue)
- **Style**: Clean, geometric, technical

### Logo Versions

| Version | File | Usage |
|---------|------|-------|
| Standard | `logo.png` | General use, profile pictures |
| With Text | `logo-text.png` | Documentation headers, banners |
| Icon Only | `logo-icon.png` | App icons, favicons |

### Color Palette

```css
--vaultum-primary-start: #00D4FF;  /* Cyan */
--vaultum-primary-end: #0066FF;    /* Blue */
--vaultum-dark-bg: #0A0E27;        /* Dark Navy */
--vaultum-light-bg: #FFFFFF;       /* White */
```

### Usage Notes

- Always maintain aspect ratio
- Ensure adequate padding around logo
- Use on contrasting backgrounds for visibility
- Prefer SVG for scalability when possible

### Previous Branding

The previous shield-based logo has been archived. The new hexagonal design better represents our modular architecture and forward-thinking approach to smart account security.
